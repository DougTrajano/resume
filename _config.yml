  Hi! I'm Douglas, a Data Scientist with 5 years of experience developing amazing <mark>Data Products</mark> and <mark>researches</mark>.

  I've worked on projects such as MLOps, NLP, recommendation systems, analysis, researches, experiments and A/B tests in different business contexts. I also helped define data science processes, tools and strategies in the companies I've worked in.

  Currently, I'm diving deeper into the field by pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science from [PUCRS](https://www.pucrs.br/), one of the leading universities in Brazil.

  In my free time, I'm a <mark>CS:GO</mark> and <mark>Age of Empires</mark> player. :)
