  Hi! I'm Douglas, a Data Scientist with 5 years of experience developing amazing <mark>Data Products</mark> and <mark>researches</mark>.

  I've worked on projects such as MLOps, NLP, recommendation systems, analysis, researches, experiments and A/B tests in different business contexts. I also helped define data science processes, tools and strategies in the companies I've worked in.

  Currently, I'm diving deeper into the field by pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science from [PUCRS](https://www.pucrs.br/), one of the leading universities in Brazil.

  In my free time, I'm a <mark>CS:GO</mark> and <mark>Age of Empires</mark> player. :)

          Development of data science solutions for customer service in conversational channels such as WhatsApp and WebChat, working throughout the entire life cycle (design, development, deployment, and support).

          Highlights:

          - Developed an Intent Recommendation NLP Pipeline that filters relevant messages and clusters them into new intents, enabling developers to create new intents without the need to manually label the data.
          - Developed a Learning to Rank model to suggest relevant intents for the welcome message of the virtual assistant based on the customer’s profile.
          - Worked with other data scientists to develop a methodology and tools to democratize data science inside Sicredi. Specifically, I wrote a Python library to better integrate our models with the MLOps tools used by the company.
          - Developed a web application that generates advanced reports about the performance of the chatbot’s models, using techniques like cross-validation and integrations with MongoDB and APIs, etc.
